## NB:

- In here there's just a bunch of work series that I solve in my projects 😁!

  > And sorry, there's in fucking French lol, who still uses french in programming in 2024 😂. Well tell my university, I promise just this course it's in French others are in English ( yaaay 😅)

- I may translate these series to English, if I have time to it, I forgoy just ping me, I'll see what I can do 😊.
