# Table of Content

- [Introduction-JEE](./Introduction-JEE/) : In this First Project we will be creating our first project using JEE with NETBEANS IDE, I'll be using NetBeans IDE 8.2, and for hosting the application we will be using [GlassFish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlassFish) server throughout all the path, so basically this first projects serves as introductory project for setting up the server, getting to know a little bit the sythax of Java classes (Servlet, Static Content (HTML)).

  - The resource to look into are the Following:[JAVA-JEE-Basics](./Resources/TP%20N°1_Composant%20Web_Servlet.pdf)
  - This Notion page contains a walkthrough of the code I've written for the project. I recommend that you refrain from viewing it until you are prepared to review the answers.
    > Coming Soon😛 (Or Send me a dm, remind me 😁)

- [JSP-Servlet-Project](./PROJET1_JSP/): This project comprises a series of exercises that cover the fundamentals of using Servlets, JSP, and passing variables through sessions. These exercises are designed with a range of real-world scenarios, progressing from easy to challenging levels.

- [Hibernate-Introduction](./Hibernate-Introduction): In this first project, I'll dive into the world of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) with Hibernate. I will start by setting up a Hibernate configuration file and creating my first Hibernate entity linked to a Relational DB. Basically I will create a CRUD web app (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Hibernate Framework. But take it easy in this project, I may not implement all the CRUD operations, but don't worry a next to come project where I will implement all the CRUD operations. 😁

- [Struts-Introduction](./Struts-Introduction/): Join me in exploring the exciting world of web development with Struts! In this initial project, we'll dive into setting up Struts configuration, creating our first Struts action, and mastering efficient user request handling. Get ready for an exhilarating journey into Struts development! 💻🚀
